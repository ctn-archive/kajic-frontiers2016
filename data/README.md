# Explanation of data sets

## associationmtrices
Google Ngram and FAN matrices generated by scripts in the script repository.

## rat
RAT problems with different problem set sizes (useful for running shorter
simulations). Problems are the same as in the study with humans from Smith et
al. (2013).

## responses
The .csv output (either human or model data) that is used by the analyser. The
header of the file contains:

`prob_id,cue1,cue2,cue3,solution,correct,responses,timings`

followed by the rows indicating problem trials for example:

`8,HIGH,BOOK,SOUR,NOTE,False,"TASTE,MILK,SALT,ACID,DREAM,BITTER,FAT,HOUSE,HOME,LOCAL,STATE,MOUNTAIN,WOODS,LEMON,TREE,TALL,SHORT"`

## wordvectors
Word vectors generated from FAN and Ngram data of different dimensionality.
Also generated by the scripts in the repository.

## spa_vocabularies
A set of random, almost orthogonal word vectors generated. Set of word vectors
is a vocabulary and they are generated in the notebook
`Generate_spa_vocabularies` in the notebook directory. We use 56 generated different
vocabularies to simulate 56 participants in the experiment. Vocabularies can
also be created on the fly (so there's no need to store them), but when running
large simulations it is quicker to load them from the drive than generate them.
